# TerraformConfig

This is a working project. We are building a VPC in AWS with 4 subnets with 2 of them being private. We are then creating the public and private route tables and associating them with the appropriate subnets. Last we are adding a Internet Gateway for our public subnets. As mentioned, this is a work-in-progress and feel free to use.
